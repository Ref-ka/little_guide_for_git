# Hi, there is little roadmap for work with git!
---
## First step is download git (and gitbush if you work on windows)

## Second step is make derictory 

### For moving you can use:

cd (a name of derictory/ "~" to move to root derictory in your computer/ ".." to move up from current derictory)

### For actions with files and derictories you can use:
1. touch (a name of file) "makes file"
2. mkdir (a name of derictory) "makes derictory"
3. rm (a name of file or derictory) "deletes a file or empty derictory"
4. rmdir (a name of derictory) "deletes full derictory"
